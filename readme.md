# PyBox Editor
A simple text-based editor that includes a toolbox for exploration and explanation of fundamental coding concepts in python. The toolbox allows users to hover over things and simply learn what they can do in order to accomplish their tasks. This will potentially help with the blocks-to-text transition.
